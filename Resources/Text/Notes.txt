Features & Use
===============
[Tournament Enlisting Tab]
The start of the program lies within this tab. The core functionality
of this tab is to allow tournament hosters to manually register
their players into the program.
The tab also has a green arrow that will flush all player names into
the commentators list which will populate it further.
The tab also allows users to attach their own sponsorships as well.

To begin using this tab you must first declare all the locations
within the Files Tab, an error will be thrown if you have not done so.


[Stream Updater Tab]
The heart of the this program lies here. The core functionality simply
put, allows you to manipulate text files and an easy to read environment.
Very self explanatory, on the left of players is the sponsor, to the
right are the players, and so on.
You do NOT have to click update after clicking the '+' or '-' buttons,
this does it automatically to save a HUGE amount of time.

To begin using this tab you must first declare all the locations
within the Files Tab, an error will be thrown if you have not done so.


[Render Tab] - Allows to control and render the stream.
Using FFmpeg and Java, this part of the program is far more sophisticated 
than the rest of the program.
Load Render will allow you to select a saved object that appears on your Desktop.
NOTICE! If you transfer the file between computers, there are problems.
The second computer requires
- Same user name
- Same file name
- Same file location aka where it was monitoring the file before.

Render During Stream allows you to capture, create thumbnails, etc during the stream.
Enjoy!


[Bracket Tab] - Beta, Hidden. Developers this hasn't been built yet
Soon to be the very own bracket generator, not needing Internet 
to use it unlike Challonge (I enjoy using this). 
Temporary/Perm solution is within the Files Tab.


[Files Tab]
The brains, the everything of this program. The tab manages the text
files, pictures, etc that this program runs through. Basically,
this is touching the OS without you having to.
Very self explanatory so no talking about the text fields, every time
a change is made to the URLS, use Load Files to throw it into the
program.

Load Data From Excel Sheets (Beta)
This part of the tab will allow you to gather all your entrants for
the tournament and throw them into the enlisting.
The two column searches are for Players and their Information (Twitter),
etc, like you saw in the first tab.

Load Bracket URL
New and amazing, using the power of JavaFX, this tiny part of the tab
will load any URL, well... Just use it for Brackets. 

Save Config & Remove
This function is quite simply, save your configurations to the system
or remove them. Developers, this function checks for the OS, check it out.



Want to develop?
================
Before developing I suggest the following
- Donate, I really enjoy people using this program and money (sadly)
helps me stay programming things I WANT to program.
- Know Java and JavaFX (Java but stranger)
- Have eclipse, netbeans, any IDE.
