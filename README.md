A file manipulation program to better manage your stream

Developed by Kyle Darling
Written in Java

Requirements
Windows 7 or higher
Latest Java Runtime Enviornment (JRE)

RAM: 4GB or higher, 8GB or higher if streaming
CPU: Quad core 2.6Ghz or higher
HDD: 20GB or higher, especially if streaming

Installation
1. Download repository/master.zip
2. Extract master.zip to Desktop or any safe location
3. Extract Stream.rar, .rar is to avoid any Linux platforms without any 
   .rar extraction capability
4. Run StreamUpdaterVersion3.jar, preferably through CMD to view any outputs/error.
   To run inside CMD, open up a new Command Prompt, cd to location and type java -jar StreamUpdaterVersion3.jar
   Only will work if environmental labels are setup, if not then an error will be thrown.
   
Operating
Upon entering the program for the first time, proceed by
1. Go to the Files Tab, link all the folders it asks for.
2. Click Save Configuration, this will save it to your system so you won't have to repeat step 1 anymore.
3. Click load files, this will have to happen everytime you start the program.

Further operation
If you are returning to the program then
1. Files Tab -> Load files

Everything else is self explanatory, there is a read me inside the Stream.rar to further explain the program.
